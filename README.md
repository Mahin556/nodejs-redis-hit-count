# nodejs-redis-hit-count

The code uses the Express web server package to create a simple hit tracking application. Each time you visit the app, it logs your hit in Redis, then displays the total number of page loads.

Use npm to install the appâ€™s dependencies:
```
$ npm install express redis
```

In the app.js file, we set the Redis client URL to redis:6379. The redis hostname matches the name of the redis service in docker-compose.yml. 

Compose uses the names of your services to assign your container hostnames; because the containers are part of the same Docker network, your app container can resolve the redis hostname to your Redis instance.
